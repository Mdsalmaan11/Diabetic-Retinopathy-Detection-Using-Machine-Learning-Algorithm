# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
 The dataset is taken from UCI-Repository.

 It is clear that it is a Classification Algorithm.
 
 Few basic operations are performed in the dataset.
 
 finally,Three algorithms (LR,LDA,CART) are trained on the dataset using kfold cross validation method and finally resulted that LR is best among the three algorithms.
 
 Then Few plottings such as box and whisker plot,Correlation matrix,Scatter matrix is derived to visualize the dataset.
 
 finally the model(LR) is used to predict whether the case is diabetic retinopathy positive or negative.
 
 i.e) 0 DR-negative and
      1 DR-positive
